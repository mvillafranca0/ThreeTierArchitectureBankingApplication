# Three Tier Architecture Banking Application
## Michael Villafranca for CSCI_4380 Systems Development with Java: April 2021
### Description:
The creation of this application was intended as an exercise in developing a 
banking application that follows the Model View Controller software design pattern.
If a Client uses one of the functions, the client side MVC will make a connection 
to the server side MVC and query data for digestion. From there, the server will 
digest the data and make the appropriate updates to the bankâ€™s database. Functions
within the application are: Login, Sign Up, Open Account, Account Overview, 
Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer, and Inquire Transactions. 

This application was developed using Java and Microsoft SQL Server.
 
NOTE: TextPad was used for the development of this application instead of an IDE, so formatting
of the code is not my best
